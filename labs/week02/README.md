Brief problem description
Task 1 tracks daily expenses and checks against a budget.
Task 2 recommends an internet package based on data usage. 
Task 3 counts normal and high temperature readings. 
Task 4 checks which applicants are eligible for a loan. 
Task 5 (challenge) finds how many vehicles were speeding and calculates the violation percentage.
Concepts practiced
I practiced declaring and using variables, basic arithmetic (+, >, <=), if-else and if-elif-else decisions,
 taking input from user, for loops to go through lists, using counters and accumulators,
 compound conditions with and, calculating percentages, and printing organized output messages.
Challenges faced
In Task 1, I had to remember to calculate total before comparing with budget. 
In Task 2, I was confused at first whether 15 GB should be Standard or Premium — finally decided ≤15 is Standard as per the ranges. 
In Task 4, matching income and employment status using the same index was a bit tricky in the beginning. 
In Task 5, I forgot to handle division by zero at first when calculating percentage, so I added a small check. Overall, 
writing clear print messages and keeping variable names meaningful took some time.
