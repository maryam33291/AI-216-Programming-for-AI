Task 1 – Lists (Product Price Analyzer)

Why I used List

I used a list because prices are many values of the same type (numbers).
List is good when we need to store multiple items in order.

Why it was appropriate

We can easily loop through it.

We can calculate total and average.

We can sort it.

We can filter values (like prices above 2000).

List makes these operations very simple.

Challenges faced

At first, I forgot how to calculate average manually.
Then I also had to remember how sorting in descending works.
Filtering values needed a loop and condition which I had to think carefully.

✅ Task 2 – Tuples (Geographic Coordinates)
Why I used Tuple

I used tuple because coordinates should not change.
Latitude and longitude are fixed values.

Why it was appropriate

Tuple keeps data safe because it cannot be changed.

Each coordinate pair stays together.

Easy to access values using index like loc[0].

Challenges faced

When I tried to change a tuple value, it gave error.
Then I understood that tuples are immutable and cannot be modified.

Task 3 – Sets (Course Enrollment)
Why I used Set

I used set because student names should not repeat.
Set automatically removes duplicates.

Why it was appropriate

Easy to find common students.

Easy to find difference.

Easy to combine groups.

No duplicate names allowed.

Challenges faced

I sometimes confused union and intersection.
Also had to remember correct set functions.

Task 4 – Dictionaries (Employee Records)
Why I used Dictionary

I used dictionary because every employee has an ID.
Dictionary is good when we want to store data with keys.

Why it was appropriate

Easy to access employee using ID.

Can store name and salary together.

Easy to calculate total salary.

Easy to add new employee.

Challenges faced

Accessing nested dictionary was little confusing at first.
I had to remember how to get salary using employees[key]["salary"].

Task 5 – Mixed Data Structures (Advanced)
Why I used Dictionary + List + Tuple + Set

This task had real-world type data.
Dictionary was used for categories.
List was used to store multiple products.
Tuple was used for fixed product details.
Set was used to store unique product names.

Why it was appropriate

Dictionary organizes data by category.

List allows multiple products.

Tuple keeps product data fixed.

Set prevents duplicate product names.

It makes the structure clear and organized.

Challenges faced

This task was a little confusing because many data structures were combined.
I had to carefully access tuple values inside list inside dictionary.
At first, I mixed up indexes.
